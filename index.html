											<h3 class="major">StimulEye - Concussion Detection Tool</h3>
											<p>I developed this app for my senior project. It can be used as a tool to help determine if a sports player is concussed. The app stimulates the player's eye using the phone's flashlight, and uses a computer vision algorithm to measure the variation in diameter length of the pupil as it dilates and constricts over time. The measurements are then provided to the user to help make an informed decision about the state of the player.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Coyote Compass</h3>
											<p>An app built for CSUSB to help students find campus resources, plan career paths, and set up group study sessions with other students. 
												The "Scavenger Hunt" section of the app has been fully implemented and serves to "gamify" students' discovery of campus. The app pulls from a database of locations and populates the information on the campus map using the GoogleMaps API. Printouts of QR codes are placed at each location, and students can use the app's built-in QR code scanner to scan them. Once a code is scanned, the app marks the respective location as visited.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Voice Message Booster</h3>
											<p>I built this app as an extension that supplements messaging apps. While it was built with WhatsApp in mind, it works with several other messaging apps as well. It offers users several features to help them gain more control over audio files they receive. It allows them to speed up voice messages, queue up several files, and play audio in the background, and more!</p>

											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/GoalMonger.png" alt="" /></a>
											<h3 class="major">GoalMonger - Productivity Tracker</h3>
											<p>I developed this app after reading Daniel Pink's "When". It is a goal tracker that helps users discretize their goals and track their progress in achieving them. The unique feature is that it uses the user's circadian rhythm to strategically send goal reminders during their most productive hours. The circadian rhythm is determined by having the user take the Roenneberg assessment.</p>
